* Linear regression does not fit very well, overally underestimates the 
years before the war and after 1980s. Overestimates years in wars
* Lowess fits better, but still does not reflect the spike in positive
mean land temperature during war
* Quadratic regression is the same as the Lowess


```{r}
years = time(global)
ww1_start = 1914
ww2_end = 1945

war.period = ifelse(years < ww1_start, "Pre War", 
                     ifelse(years>ww2_end, "Post War", "War"))
year.ds = data.frame(year = years, war = war.period)
piecewise.lm = lm(global ~ year*war, data = year.ds)
summary(piecewise.lm)

plot(global,
     main="TS of Global mean land-ocean temperature deviations to 2015",
     sub="Piecewise LR")
lines(data.frame(x = years, y = predict(piecewise.lm, year.ds)), 
      lty=2, col="blue")

res = residuals(piecewise.lm)
res.ts = ts(as.vector(res), start=1880, end=2015)
